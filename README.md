playing with neural network from Shiffman                   THANK YOU SHIFFMAN

It just ride the scooter for you xd

This is my first nn rewritten from Shiffman cause I don't have enough knowlege so please don't blame me pepegas ;)

U need to download Flan's mod and inside it download "Flans Simple Parts Pack" and "Alcara v1"

*for line detection it uses EmguCV
-After starting program put your minecraft screen to upper left corner
-press Start button
-If you want to train it more than just ride inside lines and after you are done press 'J'
-If you want to see it ride itself just press Run (Start buttom must be pressed before) and wait a second
-ENJOY 

Will edit this a lot
