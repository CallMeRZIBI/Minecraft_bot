playing with neural network from Shiffman                   THANK YOU SHIFFMAN

It just ride the scooter for you xd

This is my first nn rewritten from Shiffman cause I don't have enough knowlege so please don't blame me pepegas ;)

U need to download Flan's mod and inside it download "Flans Simple Parts Pack" and "Alcara v1"

*for line detection it uses EmguCV

-*sorry for that* in the code change the directory string

-After starting program put your minecraft screen to upper left corner

-press Start button

-If you want to train it more than just ride between lines and after you are done press 'J'

-If you want to see it ride itself just press Run (Start buttom must be pressed before) and wait a second (or minute)

-ENJOY 

-Added Stop Button XD, it ends application like when you exit from it but I didn't stop all processes before so it's nice ;)

Will edit this a lot

From here you can download it cause it's bigger than 25mb and right now I won't compile it
